## Challenge Statement
 
Due to the pandemic and the shift to online learning, the education system continues to face multiple challenges in terms of the quality and delivery of education. Tech-based solutions can bridge the gap in learning and streamline the education system. The education system includes, students at all levels, parents, schools, administration and the effects of quality education can have long-term implications on how things evolve in the world.

### Our solution addresses the following challenges

1. Shared or online learning experiences 
2. Increase student engagement

With our product, we mostly focus on addressing challenge statement 1 (Shared or online learning experiences) because it focuses on combating the lack of interest in online learning experiences. This product mimics common social media platforms' behavior but instead provides a continuous stream of learning and educational resources in short bursts. In addition, we address challenge statement 2 because our product reemphasizes education which can also increase studentsâ€™ engagement in the online classroom and provide educational resources on specific topics.
